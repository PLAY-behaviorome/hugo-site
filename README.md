# hugo-site

This repo contains the code used to generate the hugo version of the static website for the Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY) Project.

## Rendering the site

1. Clone the repo.
2. Download and install the `blogdown` package and any dependencies.
3. Run `blogdown::serve_site()` from the repo's root directory.

## Notes for staff

1. Once we decide on a final framework for the PLAY website, we'll link the play-project.com domain to it.
2. For now, you can view a version of the site on Netflify at <https://nervous-goldberg-db103a.netlify.com/>.
3. Rick has an account on Netlify to manage this. He should create credentials that can be shared with the PLAY staff.
