# Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Infants' natural play in the home is characterized by tremendous variability including variations in: geographic location, climate, socioeconomic status (SES), maternal/paternal employment, childcare experiences, infants’ and mothers’ ages, language environment, physical layout and characteristics of the home, availability of media, toys for play, and so on. 
Researchers will be able to explore the effects of any/all such factors.

However, to ensure a sufficient sample size and based on conversations with the launch group, we will limit variability along several dimensions. To be included in the PLAY sample of 900 sessions, families must be two-parent households. 
All infants must be English or Spanish monolingual or bilingual. 
All infants must be the firstborn child and 12, 18, or 24 months of age (plus/minus one week). All infants must be full-term (37-40 weeks) without known disabilities. 
The mother must act as the caregiver during visits, which will be scheduled at a time when only the mother and infant are present in the home.

*Hi, may I speak with [MOM]?*

*My name is [CALLER NAME] and I’m calling from [LAB]. We have a study for [12 / 18 / 24]-month-olds and [CHILD] is the perfect age. Can I tell you about it?*

*What language(s) do you speak to [CHILD]?*

→ If not ENGLISH or SPANISH: end call

*To control for differences in communication, we are looking for families who speak mainly English or Spanish. Would it be alright if you are contacted for other studies in the future?*

→ If yes: continue

*For this study, we are interested in learning about babies’ natural, everyday experiences in their homes–such as the toys they play with and places they go.*
*For this study, a researcher will visit you and [CHILD] in your home.*
*You and [CHILD] will be video recorded for 1 hour as you go about your day.* 
*At the end of the visit we will ask questions about your family, your home, and [CHILD]’s skills and routines. We will also ask you to take us through your home as we do a video tour capturing the places [CHILD] gets to be throughout the day and things that [he/she] plays with.*

*The study will take about 2 hours. You will receive XXX for your participation.*
*We will schedule a day and time that’s convenient for you and when [CHILD] is usually awake/alert and not during a typical meal time.*

*The data collected in this study are valuable and will be placed in a secure web-based library available only to researchers.*
*The purpose is to share the data with experts in the field so that scientists can learn more about infant development.*

*Are you interested in participating?*

→ If yes: 

*Is there a day and time that works best for you (when [CHILD] is awake/alert and not a typical meal time)?*

→ If no: 

*Ok thank you. May we call you for other studies?*
