PLAY aims to set new standards for conducting open, transparent, and reproducible behavioral science by i) publishing the protocol, and ii) making extensive use of video exemplars to demonstrate phenomena and illustrate behavioral codes.
For confidentiality reasons, access to video exemplars is restricted to researchers with authorized access to [Databrary](http://databrary.org).
